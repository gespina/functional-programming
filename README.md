# Learn functional programming using practical code

Learn, exercise and practice functional programming concepts using es6.

## 1. Higher order functions

Learning and practicing higher order functions is the first step towards functional programming.
So we will learn higher order functions of following libraries.

<ul>
<li>Lodash</li>
<li>Core functions of JS</li>
</ul>

# Process of learning

To learn and internalize higher order functions, each method of above libraries will be used to solve some real world problem.  

# Repository usage guideline

This repo uses es6, jspm and System.js.
